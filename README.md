# FermIMSRG

`FermIMSRG` (Fermi IMSRG) is a reference C++ IMSRG solver implementation for fermionic many-body systems.
Its goal is to provide a clean benchmark implementation for the IMSRG
that can serve as the starting point for a more specialized, optimized implementation
tailored to specific applications.
While it is not intended to be used as a library,
it provides several standardized file formats and binaries
to better serve users seeking to use it for benchmarking.
Additionally, its architecture and implementations may serve as a starting point for other implementations.
